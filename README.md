DELIVER JAP :
A FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM

1.1 INTRODUCTION
Our team from Al-Jazari will be developing a food delivery system named “Deliver Jap”, but we only be focusing for rider and customer views only. We interested to pursue this idea because if we ponder upon and understand our Malaysia’s business market, most of the food delivery startups/business are going through quite a successful business model. Their system are done well flawlessly with beautiful UI and great UX. This is to test our competency in developing such functionality in applying all the lessons and languages learned in web application development class by Dr Sadry. We will also focus only on the functionalities of the system or its’ minimum viable product, not including its’ interfaces. We surely hope that some of our development could at least be at par with some of the functionalities showed by successful food delivery system in Malaysia such as Food Panda, Grabfood, Dah Makan, Honest Bee and Get Runner.

1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
1.2.1 Background of the problem
After a thorough discussion, we plan on developing web application for Deliver Jap. In Malaysia, most of the customers that use food delivery app are office workers and staffs and also people who lives quite far from restaurants including
condominium/apartments. When we were done a deep research regarding this, our first assumption on the background of the problem is wrong where we assume that customers are just too lazy to buy food themselves while the real problem statement faced by customers are they are bound and tied with rush office hours and short lunch hour break. With many work still to submit, they just change their mind to eat at their office without the concerns of having to go through traffic jams.

1.2.2 Problem Statement
● Staff bound by limited lunch hour break
● Have to go through traffic jam
● House far from restaurants
● Time spend longer for people staying at apartment/condominium

1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE
We plan on achieving below milestones at the end of developing this system which are:
● Our website application have customers view
● Our website application have riders view
● We managed to integrate the information from customers to riders smoothly
● The order from customers reached to riders
● Customers have profile to edit their address etc
● Customers can sign up/login smoothly
● Riders can sign up/login smoothly
● Both stakeholders able to view their recent order/order they just delivered
● This app helps customer’s food delivered to their doorstep without the hassle to go through traffic jam, waste of time and can utilize the waiting time to do their other priorities.

1.4 PROJECT SCOPE
1.4.1 Scope
● Sign Up
● Login
● Recent Order
● Recent Delivery
● Food List
● Customer’s/Rider’s Profile

1.4.2 Targeted User
● Office staff
● Condominium/Apartment residences
● Rural residences
● Office employee
● B40 market
● University students
● SPM students
● Motorcyclist

1.4.3 Specific Platform
We are planning on developing the website application with JSP, Java Servlet and several front ends languages such as HTML, Javascript and CSS. We are hoping that it would be successful by deploying it in our localhost first without the need to buy any domain and hosting. We will be using eclipse, visual studio code and apache tomcat. We will be focusing only on what our team have right now which are pure talent and skills and not depending on any other additional costs.

1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
There are many benefits that our website application will affect towards our target user besides solving their pain points. Firstly, the rider that sign up with us will be able to earn extra income by delivering the food to our customers. As we all understand, job employment is a crucial thing to discuss in today's era as the Minister of Youth and Sports, YB Syed Saddiq also is highlighting this issue early this year. Moreover, by supporting this industry, we automatically are supporting what Malaysia Productivity Centre, MPC trying to achieve which is to increase the productivity level of Malaysian workers especially in the food delivery industry to make sure the riders earn income as maximum as possible just by increasing the delivery demands and supply in any specific area, city or rural areas.

1.8 SUMMARY
The current food delivery industry in Malaysia are expected to continue to grow while all the companies/startups are competing in the industry to make sure they monopolize the country until they reach at least the south east asia countries. We truly hope that our team could at least be par with these well-known companies/startups in getting their functionalities to run in our localhost smoothly.
We will make sure that the lesson learned in Web Application Development class by Dr Sadry will be fully utilized throughout the whole development process such as Java Servlet, JNBC and JSP. We again hope that this small initiative of ours will be able to bring value towards our target market while solving their real problems revolving around B40 segments and also office’s employees.
